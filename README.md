# Multimedia Vector Search Application

This application implements a multimedia vector search system using ChromaDB. It supports searching for images, videos, and audio files based on text queries. The application processes the media files, generates embeddings using the CLIP model, and performs a vector search to retrieve relevant media.

## Features

- **Supports Multiple Media Types**: Processes images (JPEG), videos (MP4), and audio files (MP3).
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses the CLIP model from Hugging Face for generating media embeddings.
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Utilizes ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and querying.
- **Gradio Interface**: User-friendly interface for querying media.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install librosa torch chromadb pillow transformers gradio moviepy scikit-learn opencv-python pandas
```

## File Structure

```
/workspace/Advanced-Image-and-Data-Retrieval-System-Using-ChromaDB-1/vector-search-app
├── dataset/                 # Directory containing media files
├── descriptions/            # Directory containing descriptions.csv
│   └── descriptions.csv
└── app.py                   # Main application file
```

## How to Use

1. Place your media files in the `dataset` directory and ensure you have a `descriptions.csv` file with the appropriate structure.
2. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open the provided link to access the Gradio interface and enter your search query.

## Example Query

- Search for specific images, videos, or audio content by typing relevant keywords into the query box.
